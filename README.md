# Calico

Calico is a lightweight visual-inertial calibration library that allows for rapid problem construction, debugging, and tool creation. Unlike other codebases that are limited to standalone calibration tools for specific hardware setups, Calico is a flexible library that enables **building and modifying custom tools** to suit your hardware requirements. If your calibration problem aligns with our geometry paradigm, there is no need to modify the underlying optimization.

Calico features:

- Flexible auto-differentiable cost functors.
- Sensor intrinsics, extrinsics, and latency estimation.
- The ability to add multiple sensors.
- Measurement outlier tagging and exclusion.
- Per-sensor robustifier kernels.
- Ability to create custom sensor models.

# License
Poor sensor calibration is a problem endemic to robotics, yet it's typically not given enough attention because it tends to detract from higher level project goals. The purpose of this library is to help roboticists quickly resolve their calibration issues so that they can move on to more interesting things. This library is hereby granted the MIT license, to be used free of charge by anyone within acadmia or industry.

To the best of my knowledge, all library dependencies also fall under BSD 2/3, LGPL, or Apache 2.0.
